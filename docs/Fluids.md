## Fluids

### Radioactive Water
>Water after it came in contact with fuel rods or other radioactive materials.

It has a radiation-strength from 1 to 100. When it comes in contact with other water
it transforms the water to radioactive water and shares half of the radiation strength.
For example if it has a strength of 100, and it touches a water block, both will become 
radioactive water with a strength of 50.

### Steam
>Water after it got heated up enough to boil

Water can be heated up by heating elements touching a water block, or by

### Hydrogen
Can be obtained through electrolysis, of filtered out of air.

### Oxygen
Can be obtained through electrolysis, of filtered out of air.

### Carbon monoxide
Poisonous, flammable gas. Result of partial combustion. Partial combustion happens
when not enough oxygen is provided.

### Carbon dioxide
Result of complete combustion. Often a waste product
